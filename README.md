# SharePoint 'Time to read' solution

This solution allows you to display an estimated read time (Time to read) on modern SharePoint pages. It uses the Power Platform (Power Automate) to achieve this and is typically designed for Intranet/Viva Connections scenarios. This has been a common ask from many of my customers so I decided to make it into a reusable solution.

It comprises of a single Power Automate flow coupled with two additional columns added to the 'Site Pages' library (either directly OR via Content Types). 

All content on the page is counted when estimating the time to read including Web Parts.
